Good--

Meet Ariel, asks if you are OK.

Look around for a bit, find an item (Unknown as of now)

Ask Ariel her name, what happened etc. (Explains the story as to why you are down there)

Only human left???

Teleports you out of there, says you are now safe.

Stay in the Titan house.

Looks around, once spoken to Ariel's 'family', they get ambushed.

You can choose whether to help defend or to help attack.

Whatever item you picked up helps you a huge deal.

(Good)

Ariel thanks you for your help and gives you a personal titan to help you find  a way out of the planet you are on. Ariel asks you if you want to help out in the war (automatic answer has to be yes).

Ariel takes you to the training ground and teaches you how to fight.

Once learned, she gives you an item of communication, so she can call you at anytime.

Lets you embark on your own journey (She appears to be following you though, to make sure you are ok and appears at every village, as a civillian you can talk to, may play a bigger role later.).
